# --- Core PHP and Domain Configuration ---

# Ensure RewriteEngine is on for URL rewriting
RewriteEngine On

# Optional: Force HTTPS (uncomment if your new hosting uses HTTPS and you want to enforce it)
# RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
# RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]

# --- PHP Script Execution Without .php Extension ---
# This block allows you to access files like 'login.php' as just '/login'

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.php -f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.php [L]

# Prevent direct access to .php files (optional but good practice for clean URLs)
# If someone tries to access 'login.php', they'll get a 404
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} "^[^ ]* .*?\.php[? ].*$"
RewriteRule .* - [L,R=404]

# --- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration ---
# This is crucial for your React frontend to communicate with your PHP backend.

# Allow requests from your specific React frontend domain
# REPLACE 'https://your-react-app-domain.com' with your actual frontend domain
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://your-react-app-domain.com"

# Allow common HTTP methods used by APIs
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE"

# Allow common headers that your React app might send (e.g., Content-Type, Authorization for tokens)
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization"

# If your React app sends credentials (like cookies or HTTP authentication), set this to "true"
# Otherwise, leave it as "false" or remove the line if you don't use credentials.
# Note: If set to "true", Access-Control-Allow-Origin cannot be "*"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"

# Cache preflight request for 1 day (optional, improves performance)
Header set Access-Control-Max-Age "86400"

# Handle preflight OPTIONS requests for CORS
# This ensures that browsers can send an OPTIONS request first to check CORS policy
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} OPTIONS
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1 [R=200,L]

# --- Other General Security/Performance Directives (Optional) ---

# Disable directory Browse (prevents listing files if no index file is present)
Options -Indexes

# Deny access to .htaccess itself
<Files .htaccess>
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>
